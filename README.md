# week-4-game

I wasn't feel too well, so I decided to just copy the design of the demo game instead of trying to design something a little more creative and just focus on practicing using jQuery like the homework is about.

My javascript is a little messy as a result.

Font is from http://www.dafont.com/star-jedi.font and is free.

Images are pulled/screenshotted from my copy of the Star Wars Holiday Special Rifftrax.
